# Commit Message Guidelines

Use bracketed tags to describe the intent of every commit. Format:

```
[Tag] short summary written in imperative mood
```

Accepted tags (extend as needed):

- `[Feature]` — new capabilities or functionality.
- `[Fix]` — bug fixes or refactors that address defects.
- `[Docs]` — documentation or comment-only updates.
- `[Chore]` — dependency bumps, tooling, or maintenance.
- `[Test]` — test coverage additions or adjustments.

Examples:

- `[Feature] add audio intent classifier`
- `[Fix] handle empty transcription results`
- `[Docs] describe local setup process`

Keep summaries under 72 characters and reference issue IDs when applicable, e.g. `[Fix] prevent crash on empty intent (#123)`.
